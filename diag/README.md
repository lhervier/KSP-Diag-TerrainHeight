# The saves and the runs

Part of [KSP Diag - Terrain Height](../README.md): the saves and the logs of
[the loading protocol](../docs/the-protocol-loading.md),
[the approach protocol](../docs/the-protocol-approach.md),
[the switching protocol](../docs/the-protocol-switching.md),
[the runway protocol](../docs/the-protocol-runway.md),
[the driving protocol](../docs/the-protocol-driving.md) and
[the protocol of the runway and the grass while the world moves](../docs/the-protocol-driving-runway.md),
and the scripts that play them. What their readings say is in
[The measurements: loading the same save](../docs/the-measurements-loading.md),
[The measurements: coming back to a craft you left](../docs/the-measurements-approach.md),
[The measurements: switching to a craft far away](../docs/the-measurements-switching.md),
[The measurements: the runway and the grass beside it](../docs/the-measurements-runway.md),
[The measurements: driving on while the world moves](../docs/the-measurements-driving.md) and
[The measurements: the runway and the grass, while the world moves](../docs/the-measurements-driving-runway.md).

## The saves of the loading protocol

A lone capsule, then the same capsule on a small flat fuel tank, each landed on its own spot of the four
worlds of stock KSP, made by steps 1 to 3 of [the protocol](../docs/the-protocol-loading.md):

- [`reload-kerbin-1part.sfs`](reload-kerbin-1part.sfs) and [`reload-kerbin-2parts.sfs`](reload-kerbin-2parts.sfs)
  — on the levelled grass of the KSC, just south-west of the west end of the runway;
- [`reload-mune-1part.sfs`](reload-mune-1part.sfs) and [`reload-mune-2parts.sfs`](reload-mune-2parts.sfs)
  — on flat ground on the Mun;
- [`reload-minmus-1part.sfs`](reload-minmus-1part.sfs) and [`reload-minmus-2parts.sfs`](reload-minmus-2parts.sfs)
  — on the frozen flats of Minmus;
- [`reload-gilly-1part.sfs`](reload-gilly-1part.sfs) and [`reload-gilly-2parts.sfs`](reload-gilly-2parts.sfs)
  — on Gilly.

Copy a save into the folder of a sandbox game and load it from that game.

## The scripts

Each plays a protocol through [KSP-MCPServer](https://github.com/lhervier/KSP-MCPServer), with Python 3
alone; how to run it is at the top of the file, and in the chapter *Played by a script* of its protocol.

- [`automation/run-loading.py`](automation/run-loading.py) — the loading protocol.
- [`automation/run-approach.py`](automation/run-approach.py) — the approach protocol.
- [`automation/run-switching.py`](automation/run-switching.py) — the switching protocol.
- [`automation/run-runway.py`](automation/run-runway.py) — the runway protocol.
- [`automation/run-driving.py`](automation/run-driving.py) — the driving protocol.
- [`automation/run-driving-runway.py`](automation/run-driving-runway.py) — the protocol of the runway
  and the grass while the world moves.

## The runs of the loading protocol

KSP 1.12.5 with Harmony, ModuleManager, KSP Community Fixes 1.41.1, this mod,
KSP Diag - Landed Vessel and KSP-MCPServer, every save played by `run-loading.py`, six loadings each.

- [`runs/loading-stock.log`](runs/loading-stock.log) — the `KSP.log` of the session the eight saves
  above were played in, one after the other.
- `runs/reload-<world>-<1part|2parts>-stock-script.txt` — what the script printed for each save, and
  `runs/reload-<world>-<1part|2parts>-stock-lines.json`, every line it recorded, in both instruments:
  for instance [`runs/reload-kerbin-1part-stock-lines.json`](runs/reload-kerbin-1part-stock-lines.json).
- [`runs/loading-rss-stock.log`](runs/loading-rss-stock.log) — on Real Solar System (see
  [On Real Solar System](#on-real-solar-system)): the session `reload-moon-rss-resave.sfs` then
  `reload-earth-rss-resave.sfs` were played in; what the script printed and the lines it recorded, in
  [`runs/reload-moon-rss-resave-stock-script.txt`](runs/reload-moon-rss-resave-stock-script.txt),
  [`runs/reload-moon-rss-resave-stock-lines.json`](runs/reload-moon-rss-resave-stock-lines.json),
  [`runs/reload-earth-rss-resave-stock-script.txt`](runs/reload-earth-rss-resave-stock-script.txt) and
  [`runs/reload-earth-rss-resave-stock-lines.json`](runs/reload-earth-rss-resave-stock-lines.json).

## The saves of the other protocols

- [`approach-kerbin.sfs`](approach-kerbin.sfs) — the save the approach protocol uses: a capsule
  landed on the flat grass west of the KSC, and a rover 26 m from it.
- [`driving-kerbin.sfs`](driving-kerbin.sfs) — the save the driving protocol uses:
  [`Diag2-Rover`](../craft/Diag2-Rover.craft), alone on the grass south of the runway.
- [`driving-runway-kerbin.sfs`](driving-runway-kerbin.sfs) — the save of the protocol of the runway and
  the grass while the world moves: the same rover, alone on the grass by the north edge of the runway.
- [`switch-kerbin.sfs`](switch-kerbin.sfs) — the save the switching protocol uses: a capsule landed
  on the same grass, and a rover 1.97 km to the south of it.
- [`runway-kerbin.sfs`](runway-kerbin.sfs) — the save the runway protocol uses: two identical craft,
  one on the grass beside the runway and one on the runway, 152 m apart.
- [`runway-mun-kk.sfs`](runway-mun-kk.sfs) — the same protocol on the Mun: two identical craft, one on
  a runway placed by [Kerbal Konstructs](https://github.com/KSP-RO/Kerbal-Konstructs) 1.12.3 and one on
  the ground 42 m away. The runway itself is in the two files of
  [`runway-mun-kk/GameData/KerbalKonstructs/NewInstances/`](runway-mun-kk/GameData/KerbalKonstructs/NewInstances/):
  copy that `GameData` into the folder of KSP, over its own, before loading the save.

Copy a save into the folder of a sandbox game and load it from that game.

## The runs of the other protocols

- [`runs/approach-stock.log`](runs/approach-stock.log) — the `KSP.log` of the session the six round

  beside the runway placed by Kerbal Konstructs; what the script printed in
  [`runs/runway-mun-kk-stock-script.txt`](runs/runway-mun-kk-stock-script.txt), and every line it
  recorded in [`runs/runway-mun-kk-stock-lines.json`](runs/runway-mun-kk-stock-lines.json).

## On Real Solar System

Taken on [Real Solar System](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealSolarSystem) 20.1.3.0 and what it requires
(Kopernicus, Modular Flight Integrator, KSPTextureLoader, the RSS textures), on an install of their own:
these saves only load there. The protocol is [the loading protocol](../docs/the-protocol-loading.md),
except for the last two.

- [`reload-moon-rss.sfs`](reload-moon-rss.sfs) — a capsule on an empty FL-T100, landed on flat ground
  on the Moon.
- [`reload-moon-rss-resave.sfs`](reload-moon-rss-resave.sfs) — the same craft, saved again at a later
  load.
- [`reload-earth-rss-resave.sfs`](reload-earth-rss-resave.sfs) — the same kind of craft, on the grass
  about 1.4 km west of the KSC on Earth.
- [`reload-earth-rss-landed.sfs`](reload-earth-rss-landed.sfs) — the save above, with one line changed
  in the file: the situation of the craft, from `PRELAUNCH` to `LANDED`.
- [`driving-earth-rss.sfs`](driving-earth-rss.sfs) — for [the driving protocol](../docs/the-protocol-driving.md):
  [`Diag2-Rover`](../craft/Diag2-Rover.craft), alone on the grass south of the runway of the KSC on
  Earth.
- [`driving-runway-earth-rss.sfs`](driving-runway-earth-rss.sfs) — for
  [the protocol of the runway and the grass while the world moves](../docs/the-protocol-driving-runway.md):
  the same rover, alone on the grass by the north edge of the runway of the KSC on Earth. Real Solar
  System has to be built without its runway fix (see
  [The measurements, on Earth](../docs/the-measurements-driving-runway.md#on-earth)).

Copy a save into the folder of a sandbox game and load it from that game.

- [`runs/loading-rss-stock.log`](runs/loading-rss-stock.log) — six loads of `reload-moon-rss-resave.sfs`,
  then six of `reload-earth-rss-resave.sfs`, played by `run-loading.py` (see
  [The runs of the loading protocol](#the-runs-of-the-loading-protocol)).
- [`runs/reload-moon-rss-stock.log`](runs/reload-moon-rss-stock.log) — an earlier session, played by
  hand with this mod alone: six loads of `reload-moon-rss-resave.sfs`, where the craft tipped over at
  the fourth. It is the one KSP Diag - Landed Vessel cites.
- [`runs/driving-runway-earth-rss-stock.log`](runs/driving-runway-earth-rss-stock.log) — the session
  the script played the protocol of the runway and the grass in, on Earth, Real Solar System built
  without its runway fix; what the script printed in
  [`runs/driving-runway-earth-rss-stock-script.txt`](runs/driving-runway-earth-rss-stock-script.txt),
  and every line it recorded in
  [`runs/driving-runway-earth-rss-stock-lines.json`](runs/driving-runway-earth-rss-stock-lines.json).
